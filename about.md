Beautiful jewellery created from sustainably collected real flowers and plants. They are preserved forever in jeweller's grade resin and finished with quality silver-plated findings.
 
Spring blooms in pendants with Forget-Me-Nots, Buttercups and Daisies. Summer is captured in pieces which are vibrant and colourful. Autumn lingers in conserved red leaves and Ivy.
